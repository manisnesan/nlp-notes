This is my attempt to dive into NLP which I have been trying to get my feet wet.

[1] NLP Introduction to Python using spacy and textacy - The notebook is heavily inspired from the book by NLP in Python: Quick Start Guide by [Nirant Kasliwal](https://nirantk.com/)

[2] Entity Extraction from [OpenShift Product Documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform) - openshift-entities.py - This python scripts reads the file `openshift_docs_compact_sample100.jsonl` and uses spacy and textacy to extract the entities and writes them to `openshift_docs_compact_sample100.out`

[3] Advanced NLP with Spacy - Datacamp course taught by Ines Montani.
